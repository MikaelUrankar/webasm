This tool seeks to be a one-stop shop for building and working with
rust-generated WebAssembly that you would like to interop with JavaScript,
in the browser or with Node.js. wasm-pack helps you build rust-generated
WebAssembly packages that you could publish to the npm registry, or otherwise
use alongside any javascript packages in workflows that you already use,
such as webpack or greenkeeper.

This project is a part of the rust-wasm group. You can find more info by
